Hello.

:wave:

After thinking a lot about design lately at my new(ish) job, I realized how actually vain front-end web development can be.

I don't mean vain in a strictly derogatory sense. Vanity can serve purposes for objectives beyond mere fuel for the ego's narcissism. You have fashion industry insiders who need this season's $800 neoprene purse that looks like it could double as a grocery bag from the neighborhood bodega. You see financiers with their gold/platinum/Einsteinium exclusive reward credit card. (Have I lost you yet?) Regardless of outsider opinions, these socially-driven decisions, based in a form of expression, serve as cues for one's sense of belonging to a certain community.

So what I hope to illustrate by the word "practical": I've always thought that front-end web development, as a mode of constructing a message or a façade with code, constitutes that same category of social representation toward the external world. It represents the self—at least in some circles—as a material interpretation, and uses symbols of mastery and social cues to communicate that representation to the audience. It's a face (that's hopefully less tacky than your LinkedIn profile). At worst, web design and development falls into this same category of narcissistic peacocking. At best, though, it's kind of a fun way to play with SASS/Ruby/what-have-you while fending off your cat who is trying to catch the mouse on the screen.

Anyway, that was a pretty overanalytical, neurotic, not to mention long-winded, way of saying that I finally got over complaining about how ugly my last site, and got my shit together. (Turns out supporting emoji syntax takes, like, [zero effort](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji). :expressionless:)

Signing off because it's late. But I leave you with a completely appropriate conclusion of self-representation. My coworker and product designer extraordinaire [Shaun Pendergast](http://shaunpendy.com/) made this—and I mean this in the least vainglorious sense—striking portrait of me this week:

Yep. Pretty much.
