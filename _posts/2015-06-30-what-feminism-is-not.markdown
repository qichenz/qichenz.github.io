Many women I have known, have met, or of whose tweets I've briefly scrolled past reject the idea of one definition—of one singular lived experience—of feminism.

I wholeheartedly agree because I don't believe a singular feminism exists, even if some theorists want to claim that it does, just given the way human consciousness works. But I'm not a psychologist.

Instead, I am a woman who happens to be alive. And I think that by virtue of being alive, I can offer a simple experiential (although not all-encompassing) process of elimination, as an effort in order to eliminate from popular notions what feminism utterly is absolutely _not_.

Feminism is not the ability to function in a capitalist society. Feminism wholeheartedly rejects capitalism in all that it hurts in its mercenary methodology. Feminism rejects the idea that women's labor is not valuable and not worthy of material exchange and commercial trade, except for maybe sex work. Feminism is not capitalism in any way, shape, or form.

Feminism is not about overcoming oneself as an individual. Feminism is not about blaming oneself as a woman for not being able to rise to the occasion that men proclaimed to be the occasion to which we should all rise. It is not about overcoming oneself as much as it is about overcoming history.

Feminism is not about being rejected by men. It is not a lashing-out toward a mainstream system that has ultimately rejected women for the majority of history. Feminism is not so self-absorbed such that women would embody a social movement to get the attention of men. Feminism is not a ploy for attention. If it ever could be argued as such, it is because men made it necessary to gain attention in attempts to be treated like human beings.

Feminism is not watching Tina Fey on TV and thinking that the work is done. Feminism is not watching Tina Fey on TV and thinking that we've arrived. 

Feminism is not a white woman who works 90-hour work weeks while a black nanny pushes her children in strollers through the tree-lined park.

Feminism is not "leaning in." Feminism does not require women to sway in any physical, metaphorical, or patriarchal sense. I do see why the lean-in intellectual apparatus has become such a... almost _zeitgest_ of our time. This idea that a particular type of labor is privileged and valuable, the publicly visible kind, and that no other type of humanistic project or endeavor can equally provide you the same amount of human respect and self-worth _as a woman_. This idea, by conceptual _design_, is so attractive because it is so false in its inherent anti-feminist state. This design was so well designed to appeal to our mass-media senses already desensitized by the onslaught of masculinity. We are so accustomed to hating the feminine that "leaning in" provided the masculine rationale to a wholely unattractive brand of intellectual feminism. 

That "leaning in" could dilute the power of feminism says a lot more about ourselves than it does about feminism itself, though. Its falsehood as feminism constitutes society's desire for women to be masculine. Leaning in as a mode of feminism is so false because it is entirely unencompassing and entirely unwelcoming and entirely _unfeminist_. The idea that women's labor is only valuable if women's labor bends to the will of men is not only unfeminist. The idea that a woman's worth can only come from visible labor that is quantifiable by the capitalist system is not only unfeminist. The idea that a woman must change for others' expectations of her is not only unfeminist. 

But it is violent. 

This privileging of corporate masculinity—hypermasculinity, more oftentimes than not—rejects the idea that other types of labor are as equally valuable, if not more so. This rejection is not only unfeminist, but it is violent toward women. Equally disturbing just the same, is that Lean In™ feminism is quickly becoming the (god forbid) fifth wave of contemporary feminism, in both a hilarious and heretical sense of the word.

Feminism is not feeling emboldened by your own success as a woman while watching other women struggle behind you.

Feminism is not being emboldened by your own success _at the expense_ of other women.

Feminism is not a neoliberal movement co-opted by people who use it for capitalist gain.

Feminism is not a dirty word.

Feminism is not societally accepted, even in 2015. (Why do you think I just had to disclaim that it's not a dirty word?)

Feminism is not about _feeling good_ about "being a woman." (Although it can be. I often feel good about being a feminist and being a woman, but at the same time, I realize my ability to feel good about feminism is not the _goal_ of feminism.) Feminism is not about massaging the truths that confront every woman daily. Feminism is not about turning a blind eye at the injustices you see everyday in order to keep the peace and make inconvenient truths easier for other people to ignore. It's not about a sisterhood who gets together to burn bras on the weekends, a sisterhood that dissapates once the sisters return to the mainstream in order to fit in with the expected mold of a docile, gentle, maternal, happy, nice, polite, sweet, agreeable, non-confrontational, non-abrasive, non-angry woman. Feminism is not any of those adjectives.

Feminism is not _not_ a killjoy. But feminism is also not here for any of this.

These are all not feminism. These are the very antitheses of feminism.

You are free to use these antitheses on any occasion in which someone tries to tell you what feminism actually _is_. You can help yourself, because I can't tell you what it is.

<br />

No one can.
