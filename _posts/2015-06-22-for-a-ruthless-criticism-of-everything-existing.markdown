>I am speaking of a ruthless criticism of everything existing, ruthless in two senses: The criticism must not be afraid of its own conclusions, nor of conflict with the powers that be. 

##### —Karl Marx in a letter to Arnold Ruge, September 1843

<br />

What I find valuable in critical theory is the unadulterated confrontation of all that causes suffering in modern (or even postmodern) society as we know it today. Critical theorists have no artifically sweetened Splenda view of the way things work sociologically or politically. In the age of _populus extrema_, criticism offers a diametrically oppositional view, a view of the populus dystopia too scary for mainstream media (one exception: this reference to our collective "<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lukebailey/lets-fetishise-some-commodities#.nw44q7AnAQ" target="_blank">capitalist hellscape</a>").

It is, at once, anxiously terrible.

And yet, despite the fear it induces.

I can't bury my head under the sand.

Marx, Benjamin, Hegel, et al., comfort me, and quite often. Honestly, it's a lot better than therapy. Harsh words paint harsh colors onto surfaces that most people are happy to leave blandly beige. Which is not to say that beige isn't real. It very well is—in some *way*. We live in a state of alienation, which is not the same as our alienation not being real or our lives not being a reflection of our "true" selfhoods. In Marx's contribution to the Critique of Hegel's _Philosophy of Right_, he wrote that religion, as a world theory and a moral institution, is "the fantastic realization of the human being inasmuch as the human being possess no true reality." We are once living in a time in which we are all alienated, but we do our best to be honest within. We are inverted beings, but only because we live in a state of inversion. 

Ironically, this realization that an alienated life can still be a true life is crucial to why it's comforting. The painful truths that such criticisms of materialism, as well as criticisms of this alienated era of existence, act as both confrontations and self-medication.

Mostly self-medication.

Material accumulation is a funny thing. As a form of currency that's inherently tied to object fetishism, materialism and the associated mainstream lifestyle that is indicative of our zeitgeist presupposes a sort of societal structure in which external validation is just as significant as any other kind of validation. For example, a survivalist validation (labor in exchange for livelihood). A biologically determinist validation (parental approval as a mode of perpetuating the human species). But this type of sociological, social validation is unique given its root in the specific contradiction of its perceived value. 

Materially-induced societal validation is inextricably linked to Bourdieu-esque ideas of not only resource acquisition as a human mode of peacocking, but the *right* resource acquisition as a mode of ascendant peacocking. The *habitus* of moving around or up in the world—oftentimes, *others'* worlds—and subjecting oneself to the whims of alienated people just like oneself.

But this necessity for external validation and therefore material accumulation, which *necessarily* depends on the existence of object fetishism, then also presupposes that value is absolutely equivalent to Marx's labor theory of value. On the inversion of the individual in a society that places value on production, Marx noted the correlated effect of consumption: "The *less* you are, the more you have; the less you express your own life, the greater is your *alienated* life—the greater is the store of your estranged being. Everything which the political economist takes from you in life and in humanity, he replaces for you in money and in *wealth*; and all the things which you cannot do, your money can do." In other words, what is valuable between us alienated beings in this haphazard capitalist society is our ability to consume. To purchase. To appropriate. To adopt identities based on the objects we fetishize. To subscribe to the idealizations and the imaginations of what life should be, that are not ostensibly manifest in ourselves, but are actually delivered to us, constructed not by us, but solely by others for our easy digestion. Packaged validation, and branded for easy cataloging. We are not expected to add any sort of value back, any sort of recompense for all that we consume. Our contribution may not be validated, and God forbid wasted labor in the age of labor value.

It's a strange time to be alive.

>So, we can express the trend of our journal in one word: the work of our time to clarify to itself the meaning of its own struggle and its own desires. This is work for the world and for us. It can only be the work of joint forces. It is a matter of confession, no more. To have its sins forgiven mankind has only to declare them to be what they really are.

##### —Marx, 1843

Alienated life is terrible, but so are a lot of things. At the least, it can be real. It can be real in the sense that everyone else is alienated in the same societal structure. But innocuously, I open myself to that vulnerable state in which some hope exists for a different value to take hold of the dominant zeitgeist.

<br />

And so we wait.
