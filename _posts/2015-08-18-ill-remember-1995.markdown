Molly Nilsson's music video for her latest single "1995" from the forthcoming _Zenith_ LP just dropped today.

It is, unequivocally, everything I had hoped for and more.

	windows 95, you’re long gone but I’m still alive 
	I’ve gone so far, not even knowing how  
	I suppose the world is so much smaller now


	the plans that you made  
	when you still had the time  
	I’ve saved all the things  
	that you left behind  
	but by now I guess I’d consider them all mine
	

	windows 95, is only a metaphor for what I feel inside 
	although I’m older now
	there’s still an emptiness 
	that’s never letting go somehow
	

	have you ever walked into what seemed
	to be somebody else’s dream? 
	and though the time won’t let you pass
	it keeps you looking through the glass
	looking through the glass
	

	1995
	they call the year the future was to arrive 
	but back in 1995 
	we thought we were standing on the threshold 
	to the end of time 
	(and we still do)
	so what’s wrong with living in the past? 
	it just happens to be the place I saw you last 
	and what’s wrong with living in a dream? 
	that one day the echo answers
	deep inside of me
	

	I’ll remember 1995 
	I’ll remember 1995
	I’ll remember 1995
	I’ll remember 1995
	1995
