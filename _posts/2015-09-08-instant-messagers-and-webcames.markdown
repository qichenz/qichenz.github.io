##### *Below is a short essay I wrote more than two years ago.*


<br />

Three summers ago, I became pen pals with a European friend. I was spending the summer in China, and he insisted that we write to each other. Something about email being too insignificant, he said. His main concern—I would read one of his emails, write back something too quickly, and click “send” on a message that had unintelligible typos at best, carrot-eye emoticons at worst. Or I would simply forget to respond.

The anachronistic yet romantic prospect of receiving snail mail appealed to my millennial, piddling nostalgia for all things obsolete. I said yes. Before he left, I emailed him my address. I thought he would print out the string of Chinese characters to paste onto the envelope.

I promptly forgot about our exchange. One day, I received an over-Photoshopped card of Kiel, a seaside city in northern Germany. The brief letter on the back contained pedestrian, touristy commentary—the weather was hot, the beer was cold, the Germans were colder—with inquisitions of me interspersed in between my friend’s minutiae. He ended his greeting with a string of hieroglyphic gibberish, parenthetically adding in English, “Here’s my attempt at Chinese. Tell me what it says the next time we meet.”

Then, I noticed my address. Not pasted onto the card as I had expected, the characters were scrawled childishly in blue ink, dented into the cardboard with a ballpoint pen and indicative of diligent struggle. The stroke order was obviously wrong. The first few characters were spaced miles apart; the next claustrophobically mashed together. The penmanship was altogether atrocious. 

I figured he was wracked with anxiety, so I immediately notified my friend of the card’s arrival. “I got it,” I tapped on my laptop. “And your amazing calligraphy skills.” I then sent him a card myself.

At the end of the summer, he appeared again in my inbox. “THANK YOU FOR THE POSTCARD! In our world of emails, instant messagers *[sic]*, webcames *[sic]*, I still prefer postcards and letters… by FAR!”

Knowing what technology was available to us, we were impractical Luddites. But I couldn’t ignore the parallels between the arbitrariness of my friend’s inane pictographs and the randomness of his electronic mistakes. How different were his nonsensical strokes in ink from his haphazard typos in Gmail? After all, the readability of both messages was dubious. Only one, however, was intentional.

Rarely has the banality “it’s the thought that counts” struck me as inspirational. Consider me charmed to have found its elusive moment of truth.
