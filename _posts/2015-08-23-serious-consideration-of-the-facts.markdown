Re: model minority-ism and facetious arguments intended to silence people of color, an excerpt from the <a href="http://www.mocanyc.org/about/" target="_blank">Museum of Chinese in America</a>'s permanent exhibit:

> ##### "Even people who are sympathetic to civil rights in general, including other people of color, sometimes resist mentioning civil rights and Asian Americans together in the same sentence. It is as if Asian American civil rights concerns can be ruled out categorically without the need for serious consideration of the facts, because everyone knows that Asian Americans are prospering." —Frank H. Wu, legal scholar

<br />

> ##### 『包括有色人种在内的民权支持者，有时也不肯将民权与亚裔美人共同探讨。仿佛亚裔美国人相关的民权问题可以完全置之不理，无须慎重考虑事实，就因为所有人都认定亚裔美人个个功成名就。』 — 吴华扬，法律学者
